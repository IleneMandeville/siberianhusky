These huskies also have what is known <br>as a double coat, the undercoat and the top coat. The <br>undercoat is the soft layer of fur closest to the skin. The <br>purpose of the undercoat is to keep the siberian husky <br>warm in the winter months. The top coat is made of <br>long and thick gaurd hairs. The purpose of the undercoat <br>is to provide protection to the coat and skin, repel water, <br>block harmful UV rays, hold in the heat of the dog in the <br>winter months, and allows the skin to breath during the <br>warm months. Siberian Huskies also have a range of eye <br>colors as well. They can have two different eye colors or <br>one solid color of blue, brown, or black.</p>
